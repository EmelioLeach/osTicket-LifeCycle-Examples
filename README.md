<p>
In this section you will see how to update the information on a ticket, so that we can set the priority level and anything else that needs to be change depending on how important the ticket is.
</p>
So now will change the priority to emergency because this is a business impacting event that could cost them alost of money. Then we will change SLA plan to SEV-A due to its importance, and re-assign the department to Sys Adminstrators.
